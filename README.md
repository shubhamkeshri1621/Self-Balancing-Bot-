# Self-Balancing-Bot-

Our aim was to make a bot which can stand on its own self and also can move ahead . 
So for this we had the use Accelerometer and Gyroscope , the MPU6050 has both of these sensors. So we decided to use MPU 6050 . 
We used the I2C communication module for receiving the signals from the sensors . 
We used Atmega 128 as our microcontroller and
We used two port cyctron Motor driver for better response .
We used UART communication .
